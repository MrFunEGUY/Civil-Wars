Features I want to add:

- Another admiral (and General too, but less relevent) rebelling mechanic where the admiral will progressively offer to pay for more and more the the upkeep of their fleet personally, in exchange for favors and other concessions from the state. This will save you resources (potentially a ton), but comes with the increased threat that the fleet will by loyal to the admiral and that they may rebel.
