Change the mod from Civil Wars to Civil Strife:

I want to make it so the mod is more focused around random political events (you might even say, dynamic political events) that lead to deteriorating conditions within your empire. These conditions can then more organically culimate in Civil Wars and Rebellions.

Additions: - {
	- Pressure Mechanic - {
		- Events (plagues, assassinations, annexations, etc.) add pressure to the planet/sector/empire/character that they happen to. Once a certain level of pressure is reached, there is a percent chance for that planet/sector/empire/character to have an outcome.
		- It's not necessarily a chain such that an annexation -> assassination. An assassination can also randomly occur and lead to pressure, for example. 
	}
	- Important Characters & Families: - {
		- Dynasties - {
			- Events that create siblings for ruler; create potential succession issues
			- Events that create children of politicians in Democratic states.
		}
		- Feudal/Aristocratic family Governorships
	}
	- Similarly (m)aligned planets may rebel together
	- Planets not in a sector have a malus applied
	- Sector attributes

	Outcomes - {
		- Civil Wars
		- Rebellions
		- Assassinations
		- Defections
	}
}


Situations - {

	Empire-Wide: - {
		- Imperial: - {
			- Democratic reform
			- Assassinations
			- Successions crises - {
				- Dying without an heir
			}
			- Feudal - {
				- War between governors - {
					- Overlord able to join a side, or to let them settle it themselves
					- Mechanics: - {
						- Warring governor sectors temporarily become vassals of your nation whom are at total war with each other.
						- War goal is to place a member of their family on the seat of the other governorship. 
					}
				}
			}
		}
		- Democratic - {
			- Authoritarian reform
			- Assassinations
			- Faction leaders have a high chance of being replaced after each unsuccessful election.
			- Disputed elections - {
				- The longer a country goes without a disputed election, the less likely a disputed election is to trigger Civil War pressure.
			}
			- Election Mandates to resolve situations (!!!) - {
				- This would allow for much more dynamic-feeling elections, without mandates ever getting stale. Additionally, losing an election could be a pressure point towards a civil war.
			}
		}
		- Food shortages - {
			- Could planet/sectors that are exporting food to revolt such that they are not exporting the food that they need, further exacerbating your crisis.
		}
	}

	Sector/Planet: - {
		~ Tolerance variables for Planets and Sectors signifying how likely they are to rebel.

		- High Crime/Instability 
		- Slavery
		- Religious
		- Ethic
		- Policy protests
		- Pandemic - {
			- Affected by pops - {
				- Give some pops on the planet a flag, and if any flagged pops leave they can infect other planets.
				- can_resettle_planet - game_rules
			}
		}
		- Nationalism - {
			- Conquered pops/nations
			- Species rights
			- Regional differences that develop over time - {
				- Sector/Planet that was particularly impacted in war(s)
			}
			- Desire to conquer neighbor
		}
	}

	Admiral: - {
		- The admiral will progressively offer to pay for more and more the the upkeep of their fleet personally, in exchange for favors and other concessions from the state. This will save you resources (potentially a ton), but comes with the increased threat that the fleet will by loyal to the admiral and that they may rebel.
		- 
	}

	Governor: - {
		- 
	}

	General: - {
		- Scorned 
	}

	Scientist: - {
		- Secretly giving research to an enemy
		- Wants to do dangerous/illegal research - {
			- You can let them
			- You can deny them - {
				- They might do it behind your back, try to get funding from another empire more sympathetic to their research
			}
		}
	}

	Subject - {
		- You want to control a subject / "neutral" small country (think Rome and Parthia with ancient Armenia)
		- 
	}
}
