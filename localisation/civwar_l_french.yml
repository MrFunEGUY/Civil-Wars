 # Righteous Governor
 civwar.5000.righteous.desc:0 "Governor §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§! has long been known as a person of the highest character. Unfortunately, it appears that their high moral fiber combined with disagreements over some of our policies has led them to believe that their sector would be best if governed fully under their authority. As such, they've leveraged their popular support within the sector to declare themselves the leader of an independent nation. It also appears that their popularity extends deep through their sector's military personnel. Should we not accept their independence, there will be war."

  # Veteran Governor
 civwar.5000.veteran.desc:0 "Governor §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]'s§! long history of military service to our nation is well known. They've overseen the training of many thousands of cadets, and have been crucial to the strengthening of our armies. Unfortunately, it seems that a part of that training involved instilling a greater loyalty in the cadets towards the governor than towards the state. Leveraging their extensive network of loyal army contacts, Governor §Y[event_target:civil_war_leader.GetName]§! has taken near complete control of their sector and declared themselves the leader of a new, independent nation. Should we not accept their independence, there will be war."

 # Officer Governor

 # Slaver Governor

By placing their own personal slaves in key positions throughout their sector, they were able to more effecitvely maximize the output of their sector, which was greatly beneficial to our nation as a whole. Unfortunately, this made it trivial for the governor to signal their slaves to send the taxes and resources of their sector's systems directly to them, which they have just done.
