Structure:

Mechanics = {
	- If enough pops on a planet/in a sector gain a regionalist/natioalist sentiment (via pop flag), the planet/sector has a percent chance to spawn a separatist political faction.
}

- Regionalism/Nationalism Triggers - {
	- Isolated Sector
	- Conquest - {
		- Nationalists may desire: - {
			- to become a self-governing region (tribute, vassal, etc.)
			- more rights
			- lower taxes
			- etc.
		}
	}
	- Integration - {
		- Stubborn group who opposed integration, desire to revert to previous status.
	}
	- Slavery - {
		- Enslaved pops may become nationalist as a means to escape slavery
	}
	- Species rights - {
		- Regionalist group may appear wanting better status than residency, or other rights
	}
	- Election Rhetoric - {
		- Leader wins election by agitating against neighbor or minority species within empire. - {
			- Upon winning election, said leader may implement policies that hurt said group. Ex, war against neighbor, genocide of minority species
		}
	}
	- Regional differences that develop over time - {
		- Planet/Sector that was particularly impacted in war(s) - {
			- Counter for how long a planet has been bombarded. The farther away a planet is from the capital and the longer it gets bombarded, the more Pressure it will add to a planet, causing regionalism to increase.
		}
		- Planet/Sector that has been isolated for a long time.
	}

	Removals = {
		- Killing all regionalist pops - {
			- Will likely be difficult in a sector, as killing of pops will result in more pops becoming regionalist
			- On a planet, may be effective. However, possible other planets discover what occurred and grow more regionalist.
		}
		- Aceding to demands
		- Improving conditions
		- Assimilation - {
			- How to accomplish this? 
		}
	}
}

# Planet/Sector/Nation Conquered Events

- On Planet/Sector/Nation, chance for pops to gain nationalist sentiment. Larger chance depending on how much of former nation was conquered. Lower chance for nationalist sentiment to appear if they are conquered by the same species, but still possible.

- "We have a situation developing in/on the [x]. The populace of the [former] [x] are, somewhat naturally, agitating for more self-governance. More specifically, they want us to respect some important cultural traditions that they have. How should we handle this?"
