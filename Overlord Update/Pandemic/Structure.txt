Structure:

- 1% chance / year for a planet to have a pandemic.
- Pandemics can spread from planet to planet, and between empires via migration treaties.

1. Situation appears: - {
	- Informed a breakout has occured. Different diseases will have different effects (pop growth speed, pop production, etc).
	- Options: - {
		- Let planetary authorities handle it - {
			- Small Cost
			- Only impacts the planet, most severe penalties
			- 6% - Highest chance to spread to another planet. 
		}
		- Let the Governor handle it - {
			- Medium Cost
			- All colonies in the sector are impacted, medium severity penalties
			- 4% - Medium chance to spread to other planets
		}
		- Have the central/federal government handle it - {
			- Large Cost
			- All colonies in empire are impacted, least severe penalties
			- 2% - Lowest chance to spread between planets
		}
		- Intentionally ignore the problem - {
			- Maybe you want to use your pops as a weapon? Idk.
		}
	}
}

2. Disease Types: - {
	- Diseases can have levels of severity.
		- Severity level determines the penalty to production.
	- Diseases can have different spread rates

	- Will create an average spread rate, and allow deviations.
